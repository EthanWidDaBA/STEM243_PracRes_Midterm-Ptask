PREP - 5 min
COOK - 15 min
TOTAL - 20 min
SERVINGS - 4 people

Ingredients:
16 oz silken tofu
1 1/4 cups brown sugar
1 cup water
1 teaspoon vanilla
1 cup tapioca or sago pearls

STEPS:
1. Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Cook the tapioca pearls according to your package instructions. This can be done in advance; just be sure to store the prepped pearls with some water or a little brown sugar syrup (next step).

2. Combine the brown sugar, water, and vanilla in a small saucepan and place over medium-high heat. Bring to a boil, stir to dissolve the sugar, and lower heat to a simmer. Continue simmering for about 2-4 minutes and remove from heat. This syrup, or arnibal, can also be made in advance.

3. Place silken tofu in a parchment lined steamer. Steam for 10-15 minutes, or until heated through. Alternatively, you can microwave the tofu for about 2-5 minutes.

4. To serve, scoop slices of warm silken tofu into a small cup. Top with tapioca or sago pearls. Pour hot brown sugar syrup (arnibal) on top. Serve immediately, while warm.

Turon
PREP - 10 min
COOK - 20 min
TOTAL - 30 min
SERVINGS - 6 people

Ingredients:
6 Saba or regular bananas,
1 cup brown Sugar
1 cup or bottle jackfruit
12 lumpia or spring roll wrappers
1 1/2 cups cooking oil

Steps:
1. Peel the bananas and slice them in half lengthwise. You should have about 12.

2. Roll each slice of banana in sugar. Place one slice banana across the corner of a thin spring roll wrapper. Add a few thin strips of sliced jackfruit on top. If you wish, you may sprinkle a little more brown sugar on top. Roll the wrapper from the corner (where the banana is) to the center. Tuck the sides of the wrapper to seal then continue rolling until you reach the top edge. Use water or egg wash to seal the top. Repeat until all the banana and jackfruit are used up.

3. Heat the oil to medium (not too hot or the wrapper may brown too quick without fully cooking the bananas). Once the oil is hot and just before frying roll each wrapped banana in some sugar then immediately add to the fryer and cook until golden brown and crispy about 3-4 minutes. The extra sugar will cause the wrapper to caramelize on the outside making it extra yummy! Place each fried banana roll on paper towels to absorb any excess oil. Enjoy while still warm and crispy!

4. You may serve this with ice cream or storebought or homemade caramel sauce.
