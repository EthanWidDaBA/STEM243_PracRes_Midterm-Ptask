Ingredients:
750g / 1.5 lb chicken thigh fillets (boneless and skinless)
3 garlic cloves (minced)
1/3 cup (85ml) soy sauce (ordinary all-purpose or light)
1/3 cup + 2 tbsp white vinegar
4 bay leaves (fresh) or 3 dried
2 tbsp oil (vegetable, canola, or peanut)
2 tbsp brown sugar
1 tbsp whole black pepper
2 green onions/scallions (sliced for garnish)

Equipment:
Large skillet or Dutch oven
Mixing bowl
Measuring cups and spoons

Steps:
1. Marinate the Chicken: Combine the chicken, soy sauce, and garlic in a bowl. Marinate for at least 20 minutes or up to overnight.

2. Sear the Chicken: Heat 1 tbsp oil in a skillet over high heat. Remove chicken from marinade (reserve marinade) and place in the pan. Sear both sides until browned – about 1 minute on each side. Do not cook the chicken all the way through.

3. Cook Aromatics: Remove chicken skillet and set aside. Heat the remaining oil in skillet. Add garlic and onion, cook 1 1/2 minutes.

4. Simmer the Sauce: Add the reserved marinade, water, sugar, and black pepper. Bring it to a simmer then turn heat down to medium high. Simmer 5 minutes.

5. Cook Chicken in Sauce: Add chicken smooth side down. Simmer uncovered for 20 to 25 minutes (no need to stir), turning chicken at around 15 minutes, until the sauce reduces down to a thick jam-like syrup.

6. Thicken Sauce: If the sauce isn't thick enough, remove chicken onto a plate and let the sauce simmer by itself - it will thicken much quicker - then return chicken to the skillet to coat in the glaze.

7. Serve: Coat chicken in glaze then serve over rice.

2 tablespoons vegetable oil
2 cups creamy peanut butter
3 cups water
2 (32-ounce) cartons low-sodium beef broth: about 8 cups
1 teaspoon black peppercorns
1/2 teaspoon kosher salt
1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
1 1/2 tablespoons ground annatto or annatto (achuete) powder
1/2 cup mochiko sweet rice flour
12 ounces long beans: cut into 2-inch pieces
12 ounces Japanese or Chinese eggplants: cut into 2-inch-long pieces that are about 1/2-inch thick
12 ounces baby bok choy: halved lengthwise through the core
12 ounces banana hearts: drained if using

Equipment:
Large stockpot
Large bowl
Large pot or Dutch oven
Tongs or slotted spoon
Immersion blender (optional)
Large mixing bowl
Rimmed baking sheet (optional)
Blender (optional)

Steps:
1. Place 2 pounds of oxtails and 2 pounds of beef short ribs in a large bowl. Add enough cold water to cover and let sit for 20 minutes. 

2. Drain and place the meats in a large stockpot. Add 2 (32-ounce) cartons of low-sodium beef broth, 3 cups of water, 4 peeled garlic cloves, 1 teaspoon of black peppercorns, 1/2 teaspoon of kosher salt, and 1/2 teaspoon of black pepper. Stir to combine. 

3. Cover and bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Reduce the heat to maintain a simmer. Keep covered and cook until the meats are tender, about 2 hours. If not finishing the kare-kare on the same day, uncover and let cool for 1 hour. Cover and refrigerate for at least 6 hours or up to overnight. 

4. Skim off the fat from the top of the oxtails and short ribs and discard. Using tongs or a slotted spoon, transfer the oxtail and short ribs to a large bowl and reserve the cooking liquid (beef stock). 

5. Transfer 1/2 cup of the warm beef stock to a small bowl, add 1 1/2 tablespoons of annatto powder, and stir until smooth. 

6. Place 1/2 cup of mochiko rice flour in a large pot or Dutch oven. Cook over medium heat, stirring often, until light golden-brown and it has a nutty aroma, about 2 minutes. Transfer to a second small bowl, add 1 cup of the beef stock, and stir until smooth. 

7. Mince 8 garlic cloves (about 3 tablespoons). Dice 1 medium yellow or white onion (about 1 1/2 cups). 

8. Heat 2 tablespoons of vegetable oil in the same pot over medium heat until shimmering. Add the garlic and onion and sauté until soft and fragrant, about 10 minutes. Add the annatto mixture and stir to combine. Add the rice flour mixture and stir to combine. 

9. Add 2 cups of creamy peanut butter, 1 teaspoon of kosher salt, and 1/2 teaspoon of black pepper. Stir until combined. Add 4 cups of the beef stock and whisk until smooth, creamy, and thick. Whisk in 1/2 to 1 cup more beef stock if needed if it’s too thick to whisk. Bring to a simmer. Cook, stirring often and reducing the heat as needed, for 5 to 8 minutes for the flavors to meld. 

10. While the sauce is simmering, cut 12 ounces of long beans crosswise into 2-inch pieces (about 2 cups). Trim and cut 12 ounces of Japanese or Chinese eggplants crosswise on a slight diagonal into 2-inch-long pieces that are about 1/2-inch thick (about 3 cups). Halve 12 ounces of baby bok choy lengthwise through the core (quarter if large). Drain 1 (18-ounce) can of banana hearts if using. 

11. Add the oxtails and short ribs to the sauce and gently stir to combine. Add the long beans, eggplant, bok choy, and banana hearts. Simmer, gently stirring occasionally, until the vegetables are tender, 10 to 20 minutes. Taste and season with more kosher salt as needed. Serve with bagoong guisado if desired and steamed rice.
